- Hi, I’m Agustin Ezequiel Garcia, a junior programmer from Argentina excited to be working in the game insdustry!
- This is my all neat and tidy Github account, I also have one where I have my old (and not that old, but outdated) projects that I mostly worked on as a student, if you're interested contact me!

*About me*
- I started programming around 4 years ago as a student at I.M.A.G.E. Campus (Buenos Aires, Argentina), and nowadays I work at Error404 Game Studios as a Game Programmer!
- I work almost exclusively in Unity3D with code written in C#, but don't let that fool you! I have a really good grasp in C++ too!

*Interests*
- Right now I'm working on some project ideas, more like proof-of-concept projects to showcase my skills and to have a bit of fun doing it at the same time. Check from time to time to see what I'm working at!
- I'm really interested in pursuing more knowledge of networking systems, as I'm currently working on a multiplayer game at work, and it sparked my interest.
- I'm also interested in mobile development, had some experiencie as a student and as a profesional for a few months, still learning a lot!
