- Hi, I’m Agustin Ezequiel Garcia, a programmer from Argentina excited to be working in the game insdustry!

*About me*
- I started programming around 4 years ago as a student at I.M.A.G.E. Campus (Buenos Aires, Argentina), and nowadays I work at Error404 Game Studios as a Game Programmer!
- I work almost exclusively in Unity3D with code written in C#, but don't let that fool you! I have a really good grasp in C++ too! with Object-Oriented Programming and all!

*Interests*
- I'm really interested in pursuing more knowledge of networking systems, as I'm currently working on a multiplayer game at work, and it sparked my interest.
- I'm also interested in mobile development, had some experience as a student and as a profesional for a few months, still learning a lot!
